## About
The gr**A**ssroot i**N**novation d**I**ffusion **MO**del (**ANIMO**) is a new modelling framework designed to simulate the spread of social and grassroot innovations, including the establishment and involvement of new energy community projects. It delves into how envisaged social advancements are adopted and disseminated among a network of individuals, with diverse socioeconomic, behavioural, and lifestyle profiles, analysing the dynamics of citizens’ decisions within a structured social system, in terms of their decision to join, or abstain from participating, in a Collective Energy Initiative, like, for example, an energy community (or a similar structure like an ecovillage). In addition, the model aims to explore inter-community collective decision-making processes and how such processes potentially impact the community's external perception and, to some extent, interactions between current and prospective community members.

The main premise behind the model’s development is that the main ways that grassroot innovations as energy communities and/ or ecovillages tend to typically influence larger society are through (1). *replication*, (2). *growth in scale*, and (3). *translation*. Our ambition is that ANIMO is further developed to the point that it can address all these three (3) ways; addressing “replication” as the growth of the number of energy communities, “growth in scale” as, either the growth of specific communities, or the growth of their influence through partnerships and funding programs, and “translation” as the adoption of community-relevant policies and practices by mainstream society and institutions.

Finally, with the aim of performing socially well-informed modelling activities, an extensive database is required so that the model can accurately represent and simulate the adoption of social innovations relevant, for example to the concept of energy citizenship, also considering specifications of the Collective Energy Initiatives’ structure and their context under study. Therefore, the ANIMO framework is also supplemented with a complete framework for parameter estimation as well as quantification of the uncertainty that governs its ability to replicate real-life processes and make future projections.

## Quick start
Follow these steps to get started with ANIMO:

- **Install Python 3.12.**
- **Download ANIMO** from GitHub and save it in a folder of your preference.
- Using a terminal (command line), navigate to the directory where ANIMO is saved.
- Type `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
- Type `python main.py` to run the preconfigured example.
